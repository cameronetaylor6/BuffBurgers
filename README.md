## Overview

* Title: BuffBurgers
* Description: A mobile application designed to make ordering burgers from the Farrand Grab-and-Go a much faster and simpler process.
* Vision statement: __insert vision statement here__
* Motivation: It's hard to grab a burger between classes because you have to put in your order and wait for it to be cooked - with this application, you could order your burger in advance and have it ready to pick up when you arrive.
* Risks: 
  * None of us are familiar with iOS development or querying databases from applications.
  * Some of us have worked together as partners but never as a whole team.
  * There are some logistical issues with using CU identikeys to authenticate users.
* Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk
  * We may be able to set up an email verification system using @colorado.edu emails.
