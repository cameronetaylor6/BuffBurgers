## Overview
*Who: Cameron Taylor: cata5492, (Steven) Jace Conflenti: jaceconflenti, Alex Walling: alexwalling, Alexander Luo: Alex-Luo, Callie Jones: jonescal000
*Title: BuffBurgers
*Description: A mobile application designed to make ordering burgers from the Farrand Grab-and-Go a much faster and simpler process.
Vision statement: (what you would tell potential customers) Be sure to follow the guidelines from lecture!
*Motivation: for working on this particular project (Why would you develop this?)

### Requirements
List of requirements: for the project
Three separate tables for the requirements:
User Requirements
Functional Requirements
Non-Functional Requirements
*Each requirement must have a unique ID number
Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
Agile sizing – story points
Time estimate to complete
All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.
[optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have)
[optional] you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.)
[optional] you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)

User Requirements | ID Number | Sizing - Agile/Time | Priority | Topic | User Type
----------------- | --------- | ------------------- | -------- | ----- | ---------

Functional | ID Number | Sizing - Agile/Time | Priority | Topic | User Type
---------- | --------- | ------------------- | -------- | ----- | ---------

Non-Funcational | ID Number | Sizing - Agile/Time | Priority | Topic | User Type
